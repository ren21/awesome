My humble awesome config

This repo might contain work not from myself, but from other content creators. Namely the volumebar and the Arc-Dark folders are from other github pages. I simply made this repo to be able to easily download my configs in case I have to reinstall my system. I do not take credit for anything up here, and you're free to use it anytime anyday.
